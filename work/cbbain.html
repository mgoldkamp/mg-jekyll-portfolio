        <p>Coldwell Banker Bain is a local, Northwest real estate company. They reached out to Design Commission looking to revamp their website search functionality. As a part of the Design Commission team I provided user research, prototyping and UI design for this project.</p>

          <p>We conducted preliminary user tests on the existing website to discover what users felt was missing from the experience. Using this information we created and tested a series of prototypes showcasing potential design solutions. Among other things, users responded positively to our updated content organization, as well as the introduction of local neighborhood information.  </p>

          <p>After approval from stakeholders, we took all of the information gathered in research and applied it to our final deliverable of full-detail UI mockups. Our solution provided a clean, well structured experience and at the same time allowed Coldwell Banker Bain to showcase their intimate knowledge of the Northwest real estate market.</p>
